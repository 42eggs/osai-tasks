# Task for OSAI </br>



### Task 1: SQL Query

```/t1/t1.sql```</br>
A DB is needed to run the query</br>


### Task 2: Fetching the same query but with Python and .csv files

```/t2/t2.py```</br>
Pandas is needed to run that file.</br>
I've exported the query results to ```/t2/result.csv```</br>
The original .csv files are stored in ```/t2/.csv/```</br>


### Task 3: Debugging

```/t3/t3Bash.sh``` for the corrected Bash script</br>
```/t3/t3Python.py``` for the corrected Python script
