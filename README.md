# Task for OSAI



### Task 1: SQL Query

```/t1/t1.sql```
A DB is needed to run the query


### Task 2: Fetching the same query but with Python and .csv files

```/t2/t2.py```

Pandas is needed to run that file.
I've exported the query results to ```/t2/result.csv```
The original .csv files are stored in ```/t2/.csv/```


### Task 3: Debugging

```/t3/t3Bash.sh``` for the corrected Bash script 
```/t3/t3Python.py``` for the corrected Python script
